  You can think of a bum-rush as a wave or a movement. Science has proven that
  you cannot stop a wave or movement from within. You'll get swept away and
  become part of the wave. Anything that results from within the movement will
  be a child of the movement. You must create your own bum-rush.

I saw Public Enemy in concert with LL Cool J, and De La Soul in Indianapolis, IN. I believe it was at the Hoosier Dome. It was my older brother T, a couple of our friends, and myself. It was a dope show. "3 Feet High and Rising" was the album De La was touring.

More details coming soon.
