A Hip-Hop Axiom (HHA) is a word or phrase that one may use to help them make a decision when in a difficult situations.

Sometimes that word or phrase is entertaining on the surface. There's depth in those words.

Hip-Hop is a medium for sharing coded information that may be used to thrive within a world designed to hinder your success.

I invested tens of thousands of dollars in an MBA to learn that the same lessons were in the songs I loved.

HHJs have been passed down for generations. You hear them in old Blues, Rock 'n Roll, Country, and Hip-Hop songs. A jewel is the odd thing you would hear at a family gathering.

I'll translate the information I acquired while studying for my MBA and many other axiom found in Hip-Hop.

I hope you enjoy.
